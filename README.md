# Chicago Pothole Data - Project 2

By: Eric Meyer, Kristen Scaletta and Michelle Simek

## Data Sources
We downloaded our data from the following sources:
- https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests-Pot-Holes-Reported-No-Duplica/bp3e-nw4d

## Requirements included:
1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered API(optional), HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database(SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
    - A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
    - A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
    - A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
    - A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

4. Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.

5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).

6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

## Final Project
For those interested in Chicago pothole data over various years, they can use this dashboard. The visualizations on the dashboard include:
- An interactive map of potholes using Leaflet
- Pie chart of pothole completion status using Google Charts
- Line chart of potholes by month using Plotly

All visualizations update depending on the year selected in the dropdown.
